C# Tools im making to get better at programming

# What I Made
-Vector Math Tool

#To_Do
(For Vector Math Tool)
 * if mouse clicks while over line create context menu to the right of cursor position
 * Custom context menu should show information on line such as magnitude, normal, button for maths functions
 * (Add Scale up and Move animation using deltaTime)
 * if math button pressed create another pop up menu with different math functions tooltip on how to use
 * if math function pressed brief instruction on how to use (label will do) e.g. Select another line to add
 * Select another line to add together and create the resulting line color with color dialouge popup
 * (Add glow effect around line)
 * (Add deltaTime for animation functionality and possibly smooth mouse cursor while creating a line)
 * (linePoints array in Vector_Shapes class change to start and end point variable to avoid confusion)
 * (Make Line stats on sidebar update during guide line drawing)
 * (Expand Vector struct overloads and math functionality such ad dot product method)
 * (Undo and redo keys using Z and X by removing the last in Vector List and puts into redo List and redo adds back to vector list from redo list)
 * (Save screens of just the canvas and possibly change the for loop of creating te lines to a background bitmap to save performance)
 * (Fullscreen on Canvas with miniside bar or pop out and hide function)
 * (Fix guide line being behind all the drawn lines)
 * (Add performance and memory boost to sql table queries by removing every other pixel stored for the line and creating a radius around each pixel in c# to -
 * fill in the blanks depending on a threshold gap between pixels essentially halving or more the search speed and memory used in sql table but sacrificing accuracy the higher the value)
 * (Radius Around cursor selection with a new ui element for cursor radius value incrementor like the line radius)
 * (Change the incrementor UI to be more visually appealing get rid of the basic incrementor with white up and down and possibly add small buttons for up and down)
 * (Update all the keyboard shortcuts for new UI Added)
 * (Put SQL Server rather than having it locally stored to allow others to test the program other than just this pc)
 * (Visually show when the mouse exits and enters the line rather than just keeping the selected effect on when the cursor leaves -
 * but keep the selected line subtly changed to indicate its still the selected line)
