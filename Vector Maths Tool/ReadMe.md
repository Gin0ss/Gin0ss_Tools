# Vector Math Tools
Application I Made for helping visualise math applied to vectors in realtime for other projects

# What I learned
- Basics of WinForms
- Getting Familiar with .NET framework C#
- Understanding Vector maths (Normal Unit Vector, Dot Product, Cross Product etc.)
- Background Workers and Threading.Thread Tasks (Asynchronous thread tasks)
- SQL Databases
- Object Oriented Programming
- Structs, Classes and Inheritance
- Bresenham Line Algorithm
- For, While loops
- Planning solutions to problems
- Managing large scripts
- Midpoint Circle Algorithm
- Writing to rendering to bitmap
- Considering User Experience while coding
- Organising code to be readable
- Bool checks and managing multiple states
- User input such as button press events and mouse clicks
- Optimizing code to increase performance (Specifically SQL queries)
- Figuring out mathmatical solutions to code such as canvas scaling depending on window size
- Managing exceptions and logical errors that occur
- Understanding Vector maths such as dot product and scalar multiplicationg
- Creating modular functions and ways to expand on code later easily
